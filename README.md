So when we talk about Authentication and Authorization it is used in security, particularly when it comes to getting access to a system. In simple terms gaining entry into a house is authentication and what you can do while inside is authorization.

Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying a user’s identification through the acquisition of credentials and using those credentials to confirm the user’s identity. The authorization process begins if the credentials are legitimate. The authorization process always follows the authentication procedure.

Authorization
Authorization is the process of allowing authenticated users access to resources by determining whether they have system access permissions. By giving or denying specific licenses to an authenticated user, authorization enables you to control access privileges.

So, authorization occurs after the system authenticates your identity, granting you complete access to resources such as information, files, databases, funds, places, and anything else. That said, authorization affects your capacity to access the system and the extent to which you can do so.

JWT Token
JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties.

JWT.IO allows you to decode, verify and generate JWT.
